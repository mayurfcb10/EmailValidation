# EmailValidation

Welcome to Email Validation Problem

In Use Case 1 we were validating the mandatory pattern details (username) required
for the email validation.

In Use Case 2 we are validating the mandatory domain (@gmail @yahoo) company name required
for the email validation.

In Use Case 3 we are validating the pattern for (.com/.net) domains.  

In Use Case 4 we are validating the pattern for optional part.

In Use Case 5 File we are merging all the patterns and Validating the emails with the formats 
available.
